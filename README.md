#Smart Wallet 
	It's a app that will provide the control of the user bank account or any account of debit or 
	credit,	at the version 1 (actual version) it won't inserting the accounts at the database, so
	 while the program	 is open the app will work just fine, please, report any bug or wrong feature
	 to the email: ericcleao@gmail.com. For the Google Study Jams I added a button "hint" that shows
	 5 hints for the user, to him learn 5 ways to save his money.
		1. Move bank accounts to take advantage of perks and earn more interest;
		2. Stop collecting, and start selling;
		3. Write a list before you go shopping – and stick to it;
		4. Avoid convenience foods and fast food;
		5. Buy used when you can.
